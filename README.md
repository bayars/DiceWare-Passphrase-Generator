Diceware does complicated passwords to yours with a list. You used diceware passphrase, you should be throw the two dices. Dice give numbers between 1 to 6. You should write these numbers until 5 chracter and you'll search in list to yours number. This program remove all process.

This program does generate random numbers and search in list for you. If you change different algorithm, you'll change random library or be shuffle numbers. you can change on *main-en.rb* also you may change word list. Diceware has different word list which different scopes etc star wars, colloquial idioms. You look at link for [different word lists](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) and [this link](https://www.eff.org/tr/dice).

You should use this command:

```
ruby main-en.rb
```           

If you want this script, you must have installed ruby. Program ask you 'how many piece of word?'. You should give a number what have  of words. My advice, your password must have 5 words or more for you. In this way, your password be 30 character in random numbers. You can use store a password manager because you have different passwords and lots of characters. You look at link for [password manager](https://medium.com/@shehackspurple/why-i-love-password-managers-14dad739ea79).
